# Tesla Landing Page

The Tesla Landing Page project is a showcase of a landing page inspired by Tesla's website. It incorporates various modern web development techniques such as utilizing Astro for efficient rendering, implementing hover effects with boxes for navigation, employing <a> tags instead of <button> tags for improved accessibility, and creating scroll effects that smoothly transition between sections of the landing page. Notably, the hero section features a background video to enhance the visual experience.
